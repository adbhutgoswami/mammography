      <p align="left">The anatomy
 of the adult female breast consists of 12 - 20 conical lobes.  The base
 of a lobe
       lies on top of the pectoral muscles and ribs, and its apex is at 
the areola and nipple.
       Lobular (glandular) and ductal tissue lie within each lobe 
supported by intralobular connective tissue and adipose tissue.
       There is also extralobular connective tissue which binds the 
lobes together as well as extralobular adipose tissue.
     </p>
      
     
     
     <p align="left">Adipose tissue is radiolucent, and the 
radiographically visible densities on a mammogram are the images of
     lobular elements, ducts, and fibrous connective tissue.  Ducts may 
be seen as thin linear structures emanating from the nipple.
     Lobules and their ducts are often superimposed with connective 
tissue structures.  
Whether the mammographic appearance of a breast will appear more or less
 radiolucent will depend for the most part on the quantity of 
extralobular connective tissue.
     </p>
     <p>Unfortunately, there is no "normal" appearance on a mammogram 
that can be memorized.  What constitutes
     "normal" varies within a wide spectrum.  In addition, the 
appearance of the breast differs during pregnancy
     and in the postpartum period.  This spectrum is due to the 
differences in breast composition.  A breast with a high composition of 
adipose tissue will appear darker on a mammogram than a breast
     with a high composition of connective tissue stroma (lighter).  
From a population perspective, the mammogram will appear 
radiographically denser in a higher percentage 
     of younger women than in older women.  Even for an individual 
female, the image of breast density may vary over the years.  Such 
changes are often gradual and
     the trend is generally towards a less dense (higher percentage of 
fat) breast tissue, but the reverse trend may happen as in the case of 
weight loss or in the case of hormone replacement therapy.

            <p>Because the mammogram is a projected image of 
superimposed breast structures, it is generally more difficult to detect
 cancer in a breast with a dense (i.e. lighter in appearance on a 
mammogram) pattern.
     Surrounding breast structures may mask a lesion unless there is 
some distortion of the architecture or there is deposition of calcium.  A
 dense breast
     pattern, however, has not been proven to be a greater risk for 
breast cancer.  The American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging 
Reporting and Data System (BIRADS)
     has categorized overall breast density into four categories from 
the "almost entirely fat" breast (category 1) to the extremely dense 
breast (category 4).  <i>See images above.</i> The significance
     of this classification is to alert the clinician that in the 
radiographically dense breast, the ability of mammography to detect 
small cancers is reduced.
     </p>
     <p>Other normal variations of breast tissue include asymmetric 
patterns and asymmetric size.  Although the breasts usually develop 
symmetrically, differences in the symmetry of
     breast tissue patterns or breast size are not necessarily abnormal.
  Without other indices of an abnormal process, such asymmetry may 
simply be a developmental phenomenon.
     </p>
     <p>In conclusion, there is no one breast pattern that may be 
classified as "normal."  Only from experience can one appreciate the 
variations of a normal-looking mammogram.
     While the uncertainty in determining whether a breast appearance 
falls outside of an acceptable normal range is a concern for 
interpreters of mammograms, familiarity with the spectrum of a "normal"
     appearance is to a certain extent essential to detecting 
abnormalities.
