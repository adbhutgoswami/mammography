<p align="center">The breast can be imaged from a number of angles.  The mediolateral oblique (MLO) 
view is probably the most important and most common view taken followed by the cranio-caudal view (CC).
Both views are shown below.
Additional views and positioning (e.g., exaggerated cranio-caudal view laterally, XCCL) may be obtained
in order to clarify a suspected abnormality detected during screening or physical examination.

      </p><p align="left">When viewing a mammogram it is important to know the exact orientation of the 
      image.  
      The breasts are best viewed as symmetric organs.&nbsp; 
      Comparison of the right breast to the left breast is done for evaluation 
      of symmetry.&nbsp; Perceptual psychologists have shown that the eye can 
      more easily perceive asymmetric densities when patterns are scanned in a 
      mirror-image fashion rather than side by side.&nbsp; Therefore, the 
      conventional method is to evaluate mammograms in a mirror-like fashion 
      with both the MLO and CC views mounted back to back.&nbsp; Some 
      radiologists mount the right mammogram on the right and the left one on 
      the left &nbsp;(shown in diagram below).&nbsp; Others prefer to view the mammograms as if they were 
      facing the patient with the left breast on the observer's right and the 
      right breast on the observer's left.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      
      <p align="left">There are no hard-fast rules, and positioning of 
mammograms 
      on a viewbox is a matter of individual preference.&nbsp; 
Nonetheless, one's approach should be systematic to avoid 
mistakes.&nbsp; </p>
