       <p>The breasts are seen as symmetric structures and should be 
compared as such.  While exact mirror images are 
       not to be expected, from an overall vantage point the tissue 
patterns within each breast should be similarly
       distributed.  An asymmetric area may be indicative of a 
developing mass, a variation of normal breast tissue, postoperative
       change from a previous biopsy, or merely poor positioning and 
compression during imaging.  The appearance of asymmetries due
       to positioning and compression during imaging is often the result
 of superimposition of normal breast structures.
       True breast asymmetry, on the other hand, is three-dimensional 
and should be present on both MLO and CC views.  
       Once an asymmetry is determined to be three-dimensionally real, 
the interpreter must determine whether the asymmetry
       is a benign variation of asymmetric breast tissue or a focal 
asymmetric density that may represent a significant mass.
       If the former determination could not be made, further evalution 
is necessary to clarify if the focal asymmetric density
       may possibly be a malignant process.

       <p>The central difference between a focal asymmetric density and 
normal asymmetric breast tissue is the appearance of the 
       former's density to be concentrated toward its center and to be 
forming a mass with a dense central zone.  Confirmation
       is made by its recognition on more than two views, and the 
density tends to be concentrated rather than diffuse.  Closer
       inspection, spot compression, and magnification may confirm that 
the focal asymmetric density is a mass.  Benign asymmetric
       tissue, on the other hand, tends to be larger and more diffuse 
with a morphology and pattern similar to breast tissue
       in the contralateral breast.  Closer inspection will reveal the 
absence of a radiodense center, diffused margins, and no
       associated mass formation or calcifications.  Another helpful 
guideline is that normal breast parenchyma often has fat 
       traversing it.  Breast cancer usually does not contain fat.  
       Finally, normal asymmetric density must not be a neodensity as it
 should not develop between successive mammograms.

       <p>In conclusion, asymmetric density is often the first 
impression that the interpreter notices.  It requires closer scrutiny
       and possibly further evaluations because asymmetric density may 
be a localizing sign of breast cancer.  The management of a case,
       i.e. the decision to follow-up or to biopsy, will depend upon the
 interpretation of the asymmetric density.  Note, however, that
       mammography interpretation is never done in a vacuum, and in 
addition to the mammographic findings,
       the history and physical examination of the patient play equally 
important roles.
