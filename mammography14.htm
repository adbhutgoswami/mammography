       Skin calcifications have a typical lucent center and polygonal shape.  
       Although skin calcifications are not in the breast parenchyma, they may project as such on a mammogram.
       In many cases, they may present as being intramammary in one view and peripheral in another.  If the calcium
       is caught in tangent with the dermal layer in a mammographic view, then it will be evident that it is a skin
       calcification. If there is any question, tangential views of the skin at the location of the calcifications
       will provide confirmation.  In addition, magnification views will elucidate the presence of a lucent center.

       Vascular calcifications can be seen as parallel tracks or linear tubular calcifications that run along a blood vessel.

       These calcifications are typically found in involuting fibroadenomas.  Fibroadenomas usually regress with menopause and
       microcalcifications will develop into coarse macrocalcifications.

       <p><a name="4"><font color="#990033">Rod-Shaped Calcifications</font></a><br>
       Large rod-like calcifications are typical of secretory disease but not of breast cancer.  They are usually &gt;1mm, are
       occasionally branching, and may have lucent centers.  They form in debris that collects in the duct lumen or cause an
       inflammatory reaction around a duct.

       Smooth round calcifications are associated with a benign process.  They may vary in size in a cluster.  When &lt;1mm they
       are often found in the acini of lobules.  When &lt;0.5mm the term <i>punctuate</i> is used.

       <p><a name="8"><font color="#990033">Punctuate Calcifications</font></a><br>
       Round or oval calcifications &lt;0.5mm are called punctuate.  
They appear as sharply defined, pinpoint deposits.  Punctuate
       calcifications are rarely associated with cancer, but if they are
 found together with other heterogeneously shaped calcifications,
       greater suspicion is warranted.

       Spherical or lucent-centered calcificantions can range from 
&lt;1mm to &gt;1cm.  They may be found as debris collected in a duct,
       in areas of fat necrosis, and occasionally in fibroadenomas.

       These are thin calcifications that surround all or part of the 
margin of a mass.  They are typically found in the wall of cysts.
       Breast cancer rarely produces this type
       of calcifications.

       This form of calcium precipitates and settles in the bottom of 
cysts.  They appear appear as smudgelike amorphous particles
       on vertical beam (CC image) mammography and appear as sharply 
defined, semilunar, crescent-shaped on the horizontal beam view.  That
       is, their morphologies differ on two different mammographic 
views.
