       <p>Masses are three-dimensional lesions which may represent a 
localizing sign of breast cancer.
       They are described by their location, size, shape, margin 
characteristics, x-ray attenuation (radiodensity), 
       effect on surrounding tissue, and any other associated findings 
(i.e. architectural distortion, associated calcifications, skin 
changes).
       Depending on the morphologic criteria of the mass, the likelihood
 of malignancy can be established.
       </p>
       
       <p><font color="#990033">Location</font></p>
       <p>The location of the mass may be established from the physical 
examination if the mass is palpable.  Otherwise, its location
       can be determined from several different mammographic views.  It 
is important to realize that the mass seen on a mammogram
       may not correspond to a palpable lump.  Because breast cancer 
tends to develop in the peripheral zone of the breast's
       parenchymal cone, a mass' location can raise suspicion of 
malignancy.
       </p>
       
       <p><font color="#990033">Size</font></p>
       <p>Size alone does not predict malignancy.  Nonetheless, the size
 of a malignant mass is indicative of its progression.  Needless to say,
 the objective of mammography is to detect breast cancer
       in its earliest stage of development.
       </p>
       
       <p><a name="1"><font color="#990033">Shape</font></a></p>
       <p>A mass shape may have one of five characteristics:  Round, 
Oval, Lobular, Irregular, and Architectural distortion.
       The descriptions are fairly self-explanatory, and a schematic 
picture of each shape is shown below.
       Architectural distortion is not technically a mass since there is
 no definite mass visible.  It can be identified by distortion
       in the normal breast architecture, including spiculations 
radiating from a point and focal retraction or distortion of the 
parenchyma
       edge.  Architectural distortion can also be an associated finding
 of a mass.
       </p>
       
       <p><font color="#990033">Margins</font></p>
       <p>The margin is the border of a mass, and it should be examined 
carefully, sometimes using magnification view for clarity. 
       It is one of the most important criteria in determining whether 
the mass is likely to be benign or malignant. There are five
       type of margins as defined by BIRADS:  Circumscribed, Obscured, 
Micro-lobulated, Ill-defined, and Spiculated.  Circumscribed margins
       are well defined and sharply demarcated with an abrupt transition
 between the lesion and the surrounding tissue.  Microlobulated
       margins have small undulating circles along the edge of the mass.
  Obscured margins are hidden by superimposed or adjacent normal tissue.
       Ill-defined margins are poorly defined and scattered.  Spiculated
 margins are marked by radiating thin lines.  If there is no
       visible mass, the basic description of <i>architectural distortion</i> with spiculation as a modifier is used.

       <p><font color="#990033">X-ray attenuation</font></p>
       <p>X-ray attenuation is a description of the density of the mass.
  Generally speaking, breast cancer often appears denser (whiter) than
       the surrounding normal breast parenchyma. 
       </p>
       
       <p><font color="#990033">Effect on Surrounding Tissue and Associated Findings</font></p>
       <p>These are descriptions associated with the mass such as 
architectural distortion, enlarged duct, skin changes, nipple and 
areolar abnormalities, etc.
