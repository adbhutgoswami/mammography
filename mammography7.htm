       <p>A round, oval, or lobulated mass with sharply defined borders 
has a high likelihood of being benign.  In many cases,
       a thin, dark line can be seen surrounding the circumscribed 
lesion.  This so-called "halo sign" represent a Mach band reflecting
       an optical illusion rather than an anatomic sign indicating 
absence of infiltration of tissue adjacent to a mass.  
       Nonetheless, it must be warned that these characteristics alone 
will not absolutely rule out the possibility that the lesion
       may be malignant.  Again, case management will depend on other 
factors such as multiplicity and other associated findings, but
       the decision whether to follow up or to biopsy is beyond the 
scope of this tutorial.  The typical masses that are round,
       oval, or lobulated with circumscribed margins are fibroadenomas, 
cysts, abscess, cystosarcoma phylloides, intramammary lymph nodes,
       intraductal papillomas,hematomas, and unfortunately, some 
malignant lesions. A brief description of each is described below.

       <td><font color="#990033">Fibroadenoma</font><br>
       A fibroadenoma is a benign tumor common in young women.  It 
develops under the influence of estrogen.
       Its mammographic appearance is a mass with sharply 
well-demarcated margin, and it is virtually indistinguishable
       from a cyst or a well-circumscribed carcinoma.  For this reason, 
it is impossible to identify a fibroadenoma radiographically
       without additional mammographic features.  The additional 
features that allows one to distinguish a fibroadenoma has
       to do with the fact that fibroadenomas often regress with 
menopause.  During regression, the noncalcified appearance changes
       and calcifications develop.  The typical involuting fibroadenoma contains "popcorn-like" macrocalcifications and
       is easily identified on a mammogram.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

       <td><font color="#990033">Cysts</font><br>
       As noted, a noncalcified fibroadenoma is indistiguishable from a 
cyst radiographically.  That is, cysts generally have clearly defined 
       margins radiographically when not obscured by surrounding tissue 
parenchyma.
       Cysts occur as a result of the dilatation of the lactiferous 
ducts within the lobules due to the imbalance between secretion and 
resorption.  
       Simple breast cysts are lined by an epithelial layer and contain 
clear or yellow transudate fluid devoid of calcium.
       They commonly occur in women between 30 and 50 years of age.  
Ultrasound and needle aspiration are two common procedures used to 
diagnose a cyst.

       <td><font color="#990033">Abscess</font><br>
       An abscess is a benign lesion which may or may not appear round 
and well circumscribed.  It may be associated with acute mastitis and is
 
       often resolved clinically.  Lacking a clinical history, only 
needle aspiration can diagnose an abscess.

       <td><font color="#990033">Cystosarcoma Phylloides (Phylloides Tumor)</font><br>
       This lesion has sharp margins, slightly lobulated, and resembles a
 giant fibroadenoma.  Approximately 15% are malignant, and 
differentiation
       between a benign and malignant form cannot be made 
mammographically.

       <td><font color="#990033">Intramammary Lymph Node</font><br>
       A normal lymph node is usually small, noncalcified, and has sharp
 margins.  In the oblique mammogram view, they can be found in the 
axilla.
       Intramammary lymph nodes, on the other hand, may be interpreted 
as an occult breast mass.  Magnification may be helpful to identify
       additional mammographic features of a hilus and central fat in 
which case the likelihood it being benign is increased.

       <td><font color="#990033">Intraductal Papilloma</font><br>
       Intraductal papillomas result from a proliferation of ductal 
epithelial tissue.  Often they are too small to be evident on a 
mammogram.
       Ocassionally, they may grow large enough to appear as 
circumscribed masses and in certain instances may even obstruct the duct
 to give 
       the appearance of duct dilatation.

       <td><font color="#990033">Hematoma</font><br>
       Trauma to the breast may cause a hematoma or contusion.  A 
contusion usually does not produce a radiographically visible mass, but a
 hematoma
       usually appears as a well-defined, well-circumscribed ovoid mass.
  With time, a hematoma is expected to resolve completely.  However, in 
certain cases
       it may leave behind an area of architectural distortion or even a residual mammographic mass density with 
       spiculations.  In such a case,
       if the link with trauma cannot be established, biopsy may be required to determine the suspected area.

       <td><font color="#990033">Circumscribed Breast Cancer</font><br>
       By now it should be evident that there are exceptions to the rule
 that a well-defined circumscribed mass is likely to be benign.
       Some malignant lesions unfortunately appears well-circumscribed 
on a mammogram.  In many cases, some part of the circumscribed
       malignant mass is irregular or ill-defined which is indicative of
 infiltration.

       <td><font color="#990033">Principle of Multiplicity and Bilaterally</font><br>
       Influences in the development of one breast should similarly 
affect the other.  Bilateral abnormalities with morphologic features 
that have a high
       probability of being benign raise less suspicions than unilateral
 abnormalities.  Likewise, most breast cancers are solitary, and the 
presence of 
       multiple findings with similar morphological charcteristics are 
more reassuring.  Of course, the rule of multiplicity does not apply 
when the mammographic
       features of several masses have a high probability of being 
malignant.
