   <p align="left">The detection of breast cancer involves the screening of 
      breast tissues thought to be normal.&nbsp; The x-ray image of the breast exhibits 
      a pattern within a spectrum of normal variation. Mammographic 
      interpretation involves careful scrutiny of this "normal pattern" and any 
      abnormalities which present itself as a disruption of the "normal 
      pattern."</p>          
           
   <p>The first step is to compare the right breast to the left 
      breast on the current examination.&nbsp; Since the breasts are seen as symmetric 
      organs,&nbsp; if the mammograms are viewed using symmetric placement on a viewbox</a>, 
      the architecture and distribution of density should be close to mirror images.</p>       
   
   <p align="left">Viewing the mammogram should proceed from a distance to closer scrutiny of the 
      particular suspicious areas.&nbsp; From a distance, the images should be compared area for area, and the 
      respective regions of the left and right breasts should look similar.&nbsp; One should have both 
      images in view whereby the contour of the breast, the size of the breast, 
      and its symmetric density could be evaluated.&nbsp; This bird's eye evaluation for symmetry
      is followed by a close-up individual view of each image, looking for disruption in the "normal
      pattern" of the breast such as abnormal densities, areas of architectural distortion, masses 
      and calcifications.&nbsp; </p>

    <p align="left">If there are prior mammograms available for review, 
the 
      individual breasts are evaluated for changes over time.&nbsp; The 
goal 
      here is to look for potential changes in asymmetric density as 
well as to evaluate development of new masses (neodensities) or new 
calcifications.
      However, if the present study is unremarkable, prior mammograms 
are of lesser importance.</p>
      
    <p align="left">Soft tissue lesions found within a mammogram often 
will have distinguishing shape, size, and margin
    characteristics.  Likewise, calcifications can be characterized by 
their size, number, morphology, distribution, and heterogeneity.
    These distinguishing characteristics are the basis upon which the 
interpretation of a mammogram may be classified as benign, malignant, or
 equivocal.
