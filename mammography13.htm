       Calcifications are often important and common findings on a 
mammogram.  They can be produced from cell secretion or from necrotic 
cellular debris.
       They may be intramammary, within and around the ducts, within the
 lobules, in vascular structures, in interlobular
       connective tissue or fat.  Alternatively, they may be found in 
the skin.
       They can appear with or without an associated lesion, and their 
morphologies 
       and distribution provide clues as to their etiology as well as 
whether they can be associated with a benign or malignant process.
       <p></p>
       
       <p>Calcifications found with a mass provide further information 
about that particular mass.  For example, an involuting fibroadenoma
       will often contain popcorn-like macrocalcifications.  Similarly, 
fine curvilinear calcifications at the margin (i.e. rim calcifications) 
of
       a round or oval mass indicate a benign process.
       On the other hand, a mass with pleomorphic, irregularly shaped 
calicifications heterogeneous in size and morphology
       raises much greater concern about malignancy.
       </p>
       
       <p>Calcifications are analyzed according to their size, shape, 
number, and distribution.  
       The general rule is that larger, round or oval shaped 
calcifications uniform in size has a higher probability of being 
associated
       with a benign process and smaller, irregular, polymorphic, 
branching calcifications heterogeneous in size and morphology are more
       often associated with a malignant process.  Certain calcification
 patterns are almost always pathognomic of a benign process, and in such
 cases
       no further analysis is needed.  In the majority of cases, 
however, a pattern of calcification deposition is inconclusive and may
       be attributable to either a benign or malignant process.  
Needless to say, these cases require additional evaluation such as using
       magnification mammography to further elucidate the 
calcifications' morphology and distribution.
       </p>
       
     
       <p><font color="#990033">Size</font><br>
       Generally speaking, microcalcifications are associated with a 
malignant process and macrocalcifications are associated with a benign 
process.
       The problem with this general rule is that there is no fine line 
of measurement that could enable one to distinguish between micro and 
macro.
       All calcifications start out imperceptably small and 
radiographically invisible.  Most radiologists place calcifications 0.5 
mm or less to have
       a high probability of association with cancer; and calcifications
 of 2.0 mm or larger are typical of a benign process.  The smallest 
visible 
       calcifications on a mammogram is approximately 0.2 - 0.3 mm. 
       </p>
       
       <p><font color="#990033">Number</font><br>
       The number of calcifications that make up a cluster has been used
 as an indicator of benign and malignancy.  While the actual number 
itself
       is arbitrary, radiologists tend to agree that the minimum number 
of calcifications be either four, five, or six to be of significance.  
Any
       number of calcifications less than four will rarely lead to the 
detection of breast cancer in and of itself.  Again, as with all 
criteria
       in mammographic analysis, no number is absolute and two or three 
calcifications may merit greater suspicion if they exhibit worrisome 
morphologies.
              </p>
       
       <p><font color="#990033">Morphology</font><br>
       The morphology of calcifications is considered to be the most 
important indicator in differentiating benign from malignant.  As noted 
earlier,
       round and oval shaped calcifications that are also uniform in 
shape and size are more likely to be on the benign end of the spectrum. 
 Calcifications
       that are irregular in shape and size fall closer to the malignant
 end of the spectrum.  It has been described that calcifications 
associated with 
       a malignant process resemble small fragments of broken glass and 
are rarely round or smooth.  
       </p>
       
       <p><font color="#990033">ACR BIRADS Classification</font><br>
       The American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting 
and Data System (BIRADS) has classified findings of calcifications
       into three categories: (1) Typically benign; (2) Intermediate 
concern; and (3) Higher probability of malignancy.
       The pages that follows will describe the 
       type of calcifications that fall into these categories.
